# Gumtree Frontend Challenge

## User Story
The goal of this task is to create a version of the game 'Rock, Paper Scissors' in the browser.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Ability to play against the computer
- Ability to simulate a game (Computer vs Computer)
- Ability to restart the game
- Computer generated plays need to be random
- Correctly implemented rules
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors

## Technical Requirements
You should:

- Support IE11
- Use vanilla JavaScript
- Write unit tests
- Use modern styling and features, e.g. SASS
- Use only ES2015+ syntax
- Use Semantic HTML

You should not:

- Submit a solution with compilation/runtime errors
- Submit a solution with failing unit tests

## Guidelines

### Solution Design
Your solution should be clear and easy to understand, consider using popular software principles such as DRY, KISS, SOLID etc.

Try to avoid unnecessary complexity and over-engineering.

### User Interface
The user interface can be as simple or as complex as you wish, however, you will be marked on:

- Responsive Design
- Accessibility

You will not be marked on your design choices.

### Extensibility
Your solution should be easily extendable to include additional rules.

For example:

## Setup
We provide the following tooling:

- `webpack` to modularise your Javascript code
- `babel` to utilise ES2015+ features
- `node-sass` to modularise your styling via SASS
- `eslint` to make sure your code meets the standards
- `jest` to help you write and run your unit tests

## Commands
``` bash
# Install the dependencies
yarn install

# Run solution (http://localhost:8080)
yarn dev

# Run the unit tests
yarn test

# Run the linter
yarn lint
```
